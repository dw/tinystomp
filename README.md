# NOTICE

The Stompest maintainer has faithfully copied the approach taken by this parser
and <a href="https://github.com/dw/tinystomp/issues/1">integrated it back into
Stompest</a>, and fixed some edge cases in the process. There should no longer
be any reason to use tinystomp.

# tinystomp

This is an ultra-minimal Stomp message generator and parser for Python. Why
`tinystomp`? Because its parser is around an order of magnitude faster than <a
href="https://github.com/nikipore/stompest/">Stompest</a>, which is a more
thoroughly developed module you should probably try first.

However if you're planning on parsing more than 2500 messages/sec and hope to
have at least half the CPU left for useful work, tinystomp may be a better
option as half a CPU is closer to 30000 messages/sec.

Unlike stompest, tinystop lacks:

* Thorough conformance testing
* Protocol machinery for common frameworks
* Testing with anything except ActiveMQ
* Anything except functions to generate STOMP-formatted bytestrings, a class to
  incrementally parse bytestrings into frames, and a dumb-as-chips synchronous
  debug client connection class

At some point tinystomp will include a Twisted protocol implementation, but
currently that protocol is tightly bound to the project it was written for.
Alternatively it may be turned into a pull request for Stompest.

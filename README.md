# tinystomp

This is an ultra-minimal Stomp message generator and parser for Python. Why
`tinystomp`? Because its parser is around an order of magnitude faster than <a
href="https://github.com/nikipore/stompest/">Stompest</a>, which is a more
thoroughly developed module you should probably try first.

Unlike stompest, tinystop lacks:

* Thorough conformance testing
* Protocol machinery for common frameworks
* Testing with anything except ActiveMQ
* Anything except functions to generate STOMP-formatted bytestrings, a class to
  incrementally parse bytestrings into frames, and a dumb-as-chips synchronous
  debug client connection class

At some point tinystomp will include a Twisted protocol implementation, but
currently that protocol is tightly bound to the project it was written for.
Alternatively it may be turned into a pull request for Stompest.
